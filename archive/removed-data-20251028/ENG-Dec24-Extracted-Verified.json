    "question": "Read the passage given below and answer the questions (91 - 99) that follow :\n\n1.\nColours have a deeper significance for a home than one can imagine. For if used right, they can give a perfect look. In today's time, when there is an abundance of everything but space, colour plays an important role in creating the right ambience and perhaps the space that you crave for. Besides having a tremendous potential to create mood through sheer appeal to the senses, right use of colours actually helps you create the spacious feeling.\n\n2.For instance, instead of using a plain monotonous colour on all four walls, if you get a little imaginative, perhaps a little bold, you can create a sense of space within those four walls. One of the ways would be to blend light and dark colours. Or to paint two opposite sides in a lighter shade than the other two. Colour can add height to your room too. For instance, if the room is painted white and the upholstery of your furniture is in deep blue tone, the false ceilings could be painted in a light blue shade. Think out of the box to give even more interesting effects to your room.\n3. Whatever your choice is, there are options in the market to help you realise your needs. These days you get special patterned stencils to decorate walls with interesting patterns like flowers, leaves, birds etc. Some people draw an entire scenery on one side of the wall to give the feeling of bringing the outdoors inside. The choices are many, so are the creative ways. Just let your imagination flow. Every room reflects the personality of the occupant, hence it is important to pay attention to every detail. Your walls are your canvases, freshly painted and all bare. Go ahead, splash colours and watch the effect unfold.\n----------------------------\nThe word opposite in meaning to the underlined word in the given sentence is: 'Right use of colours actually helps you create the spacious feeling'.",
