CTET Prep — Wireframe Prototype

What this is
- A simple, clickable wireframe prototype made of static HTML/CSS files.
- Purpose: quick, exportable mockups to review layout and user flows without needing Figma.

How to use
1. Open the folder `wireframes/` in your file explorer.
2. Double-click `index.html` to open it in your default browser.
3. Navigate between pages using the links (Landing → Sample → Login → Dashboard → Study → Mock Tests).

Files created
- index.html — Landing page (hero, sample questions)
- login.html — Login/signup page (prototype)
- dashboard.html — Demo user dashboard
- study.html — Study material page (single chapter view)
- questionbank.html — Question bank (sample items)
- mock_setup.html — Mock test configuration
- mock_runner.html — Mock test runner (demo)
- results.html — Test results and recommendations
- admin_upload.html — Admin upload page (prototype)
- styles.css — Wireframe styles
- script.js — Minimal script

Notes & next steps
- This is a static prototype for review. I can:
  - Convert pages to a single-page React prototype that is easier to iterate.
  - Export each page as PNG/SVG for insertion into Figma.
  - Add interactive hotspots JSON for Figma import.

If you want a Figma file, I can produce SVG exports of each page or a Figma-compatible JSON to import into Figma (requires a follow-up step).
