Please refine the following requirement:
Create an app for train teachers to prepare for CTET exam. I am planning the monetise this app based on fixed price for each Paper. My approach is, extract questions and answers from old question papers and use it for the following.
0) Separate Option to select paper 1 and paper 2 contents and questions. 
0.1) Admin Login for user curd, data upload in json format with the followings.
0.1.1) Paper
0.1.2) Term and Year of exam
0.1.3) Subject
0.1.4) Language of the Questions 
0.1.5) UI to CURD of specific question 
0.2) Add a page for user to login with highly attractive page to pursue teachers to login, review sample content and pay for full content. 

1) Create question bank with detailed explanation of how to reach each answers.
2) Create detailed study content for them to learn, based on the syllabus and old questions. They should be exam ready after learning those materials. Please be cautious the pass % is 10%, improvement in pass % is totally depend on how detailed the study content.  
3) Create mock tests with filtering for subjects and option to select number of questions. 
3.1) After completion of mock test provide the correct answer, feedback and detailed reason for mistake, number of correct answer and %, time take, delay, topic to which improvement required, history of improvement based on previous moch tests.
4) I will be providing the followings:
4.1) CTET-Dec2024-Circular
4.2) json files of Dec-24, Paper 2:
4.2.1) CDP, Maths and Science, Social studies, English and Hindi.
5) You may include some exciting features which will aid them for better study.
6) Do not add AI api key.
7) Avoid database integration, store data as local file and add feature to download the data to users machine for future faster response.
