    "summary": "This chapter focuses on the skills required to understand and analyze prose passages. The key is to move beyond surface-level reading to a deeper interpretation of the text, paying attention to vocabulary, author's intent, and the logical flow of ideas.\n---\n### Key Skills:\n\n*   **Identifying the Main Idea:** Find the central theme or message of the passage. Ask yourself, \"What is the most important point the author is trying to make?\"\n*   **Vocabulary in Context:** Understand the meaning of words and phrases as they are used in the passage. This includes identifying synonyms, antonyms (opposites), and the meaning of idioms (e.g., \"think out of the box\").\n*   **Making Inferences:** Draw logical conclusions based on the information given, even if it's not stated directly. This involves \"reading between the lines.\"\n*   **Identifying Author's Purpose and Tone:** Determine why the author wrote the passage (to inform, persuade, entertain) and the attitude they convey (e.g., nostalgic, critical, objective).\n*   **Locating Specific Details:** Quickly find and retrieve specific pieces of information from the text to answer factual questions.\n*   **Analyzing Grammar and Parts of Speech:** Identify the grammatical function of words within a sentence (e.g., noun, verb, adverb).",

        "question": "Read the passage given below and answer the questions (91 - 99) that follow :\n\n1.\nColours have a deeper significance for a home than one can imagine. For if used right, they can give a perfect look. In today's time, when there is an abundance of everything but space, colour plays an important role in creating the right ambience and perhaps the space that you crave for. Besides having a tremendous potential to create mood through sheer appeal to the senses, right use of colours actually helps you create the spacious feeling.\n\n2.For instance, instead of using a plain monotonous colour on all four walls, if you get a little imaginative, perhaps a little bold, you can create a sense of space within those four walls. One of the ways would be to blend light and dark colours. Or to paint two opposite sides in a lighter shade than the other two. Colour can add height to your room too. For instance, if the room is painted white and the upholstery of your furniture is in deep blue tone, the false ceilings could be painted in a light blue shade. Think out of the box to give even more interesting effects to your room.\n3. Whatever your choice is, there are options in the market to help you realise your needs. These days you get special patterned stencils to decorate walls with interesting patterns like flowers, leaves, birds etc. Some people draw an entire scenery on one side of the wall to give the feeling of bringing the outdoors inside. The choices are many, so are the creative ways. Just let your imagination flow. Every room reflects the personality of the occupant, hence it is important to pay attention to every detail. Your walls are your canvases, freshly painted and all bare. Go ahead, splash colours and watch the effect unfold.\n----------------------------\nThe word opposite in meaning to the underlined word in the given sentence is: 'Right use of colours actually helps you create the spacious feeling'.",

This is the direct opposite of spacious.\n*   'Special', 'airy', and 'fresh' are not opposites of spacious. 'Airy' is actually a synonym."

    "summary": "This chapter covers the principles and methods of effective language teaching. It focuses on modern, learner-centered approaches that aim to develop communicative competence rather than just grammatical accuracy.\n---\n### Key Concepts:\n\n*   **Language Skills:**\n    *   **Receptive Skills:** Skills where we receive and process language. These are **Listening and Reading**.\n    *   **Productive Skills:** Skills where we produce language. These are **Speaking and Writing**.\n    *   **Integrated Skills:** Effective language tasks, like a **Project Work**, integrate all four skills (reading for research, writing the report, listening and speaking during collaboration).\n\n*   **Learning Approaches:**\n    *   **Bottom-up Approach:** This approach to listening or reading suggests that comprehension is built by starting with the smallest units of language—sounds, then words, then phrases, then sentences—and assembling them into a whole meaning.\n    *   **Top-down Approach:** This approach suggests that learners use their background knowledge, context, and expectations to understand the overall meaning first, and then work down to the details.\n\n*   **Teaching Materials and Methods:**\n    *   **Authentic Materials:** These are materials created for native speakers in a real-life context, not specifically for language learners (e.g., newspaper articles, menus, songs). They are valuable for exposing learners to natural language.\n    *   **Grammar Teaching (Consciousness-Raising):** This is an inductive approach where the teacher doesn't just state the rule. Instead, they provide language in a context, guide learners to **notice** the grammatical form, and help them discover the rule for themselves.\n    *   **Language Register:** The style of language used in a particular context.
